# Registration

Registration will be managed by ICWSM at <a href="https://www.icwsm.org/2023/index.html/#registration">https://www.icwsm.org/2023/index.html/#registration</a>.

Note that it is typically possible at ICWSM conferences to register for the workshop only at a much lower rate than the full-conference fees.

# Program

The workshop will be held as a half-day meeting and will be held on 5<sup>th</sup> June 2022 in hybrid mode.

We are looking forward to an exciting mix of activities including invited speakers and paper presentations. The schedule will be finalised closer to the time.

While we highly encourage in-person attendance, we are planning to live stream the workshop on Zoom.
