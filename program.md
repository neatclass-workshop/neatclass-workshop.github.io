## Interactive Paper Presentations

While all the authors of accepted papers will have the chance to record a 20 min presentation of their work that will be published on the workshop website ahead of time, live presentations will be designed to promote interaction. To give space to fresh ideas, participants will be invited to trial an innovative format for paper presentations: presenters will be given 5 minutes to describe their research questions and hypothesis, and a group discussion will start after that (10 minutes). The goal is to give time to the audience to fully appreciate the complexity of the issue targeted in the paper, and propose ideas that have not been biased from the authors' approach. At the end of the discussion, presenters will be given 5 more minutes to describe their method and results, followed by a new group discussion about the interpretation and implications of such results (10 min).

## Challenge

In the afternoon we will kick off with a small challenge: participants will be divided into groups and asked to come up with hard examples that trick existing text classifiers. To this end, we will provide an interactive model for the detection of abusive language and we will invite participants (in advance) to provide their own models and tasks for collaborative adversarial testing. The challenge will work as a warm-up session for the following group activity.

## Group Activity

This last session is meant to bring researchers together and discuss their experience with the evaluation of both models and human annotations. The goal is to collect ideas for new evaluation approaches and future work in the field and to discuss how we should organise competitions when there are multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarking datasets are dynamic. Depending on the number of participants, we will break up into small groups that reconvene after a coffee break to report resulting ideas.

	  	<p align="left"> Munmun De Choudhury is an Associate Professor of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. Dr. De Choudhury is best known for laying the foundation of a new line of research that develops computational techniques towards understanding and improving mental health outcomes, through ethical analysis of social media data. To do this work, she adopts a highly interdisciplinary approach, combining social computing, machine learning, and natural language analysis with insights and theories from the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Dr. De Choudhury has been recognized with the 2021 ACM-W Rising Star Award, 2019 Complex Systems Society – Junior Scientific Award, numerous best paper and honorable mention awards from the ACM and AAAI, and features and coverage in popular press like the New York Times, the NPR, and the BBC. Dr. De Choudhury currently serves on the Board of Directors of the International Society for Computational Social Science and on the Steering Committee of the International Conference on Web and Social Media, the leading conference on interdisciplinary studies of social media. Earlier, Dr. De Choudhury was a faculty associate with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, a postdoc at Microsoft Research, and obtained her PhD in Computer Science from Arizona State University. </p>

	  	<p align="left"> Zeerak Talat is a post-doctoral fellow at the Digital Democracies Institute at Simon Fraser University. Talat's research focuses on the foundational limitations and the ethics of machine learning and NLP technologies as viewed through content moderation and social predication tasks. Talat received a Ph.D. from the University of Sheffield. During this time, Talat worked on automated content moderation and how the practice of automating content moderation using machine learning revealed the underlying political economy of machine learning, displaying issues of access, equality, and ethical practices. Talat also founded and runs the Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH), which focuses on the technical and social developments of automated content moderation infrastructure. Talat’s current work aims to identify the specific underlying causes for why and how machine learning comes to be enacted as a marginalizing technology. </p>
